## 1. the cognitive neurology of bilingualism in the age of globalization

the globalization era produces an unprecedented spread of bilingualism and multilingualism, driven by migration, communication, and international media.
bilinguals experience neurocognitive adaptations—the bilingual brain develops structural and functional differences, particularly in areas related to executive control.
early bilingualism leads to cognitive advantages, such as faster information processing and better conflict resolution, seen even in infancy.
language control mechanisms in the brain manage interference between multiple languages, demonstrating a neurological embodiment of identity negotiation.


linguistic identity: the bilingual mind embodies multiple linguistic selves; brain adaptation reflects the coexistence of languages as parts of identity.
globalism: the global circulation of languages (english, mandarin, etc.) reshapes cognition and communication norms.
language and thought: neuroplasticity evidences that language use changes perception, attention, and problem-solving capacities.

## 2. paulla ebron — “contingent stories of anthropology, race, and feminism”

diversity: black feminism as a plural discourse that resists singular meanings of “woman” or “culture.”
globalism and thought: reflects postcolonial awareness that western academic language mediates cross-cultural representation.

multilingualism: a social asset and a pedagogical resource.
identity: students’ language use shapes belonging and self-perception.
language and thought: code-switching facilitates conceptual flexibility and cultural negotiation.

## 7. joseph sung-yul park — “my name”


an autoethnographic meditation on how naming reflects transnational identity.

## 8. peirce, “signs” (stanford encyclopedia of philosophy)



peirce defines signs as triadic relations linking a sign, an object, and an interpretant.
meaning arises through interpretation, forming an infinite chain of semiosis.
language, as a sign system, constructs thought rather than merely expressing it.


language and thought: all cognition is mediated by signs; linguistic representation shapes conceptualization.
global and multilingual relevance: translation between languages is a form of semiosis—each culture reframes meaning through its semiotic system.
